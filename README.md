# Machine Learning Algorithms Collection

This repository contains multiple Jupyter Notebook implementations of popular Machine Learning algorithms and data analysis projects. Each notebook demonstrates a different algorithm, dataset, and workflow.

## üìÇ Contents

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **dbscan.ipynb** | Implements **DBSCAN clustering** on a dataset, showing how density-based clustering groups similar points together. |
| **decision_tree (1).ipynb** | Demonstrates **Decision Tree Classifier** for classification problems, including visualization of the tree structure. |
| **house_prediction.ipynb** | Uses **Linear Regression** (or other models) to predict house prices based on features like size, location, etc. |
| **Kmeans.ipynb** | Implements **K-Means Clustering** to group data into clusters and visualize the results. |
| **pca.ipynb** | Performs **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization. |
| **random_forest.ipynb** | Demonstrates **Random Forest Classifier/Regressor** for better accuracy compared to single decision trees. |
| **titanic_dataAnalysis.ipynb** | Titanic dataset analysis using ML models to predict survival rates and visualize trends. |
